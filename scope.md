# Linq adapter scope

This file tracks what is still left in the Linq Chat SDK adapter.

Keep this readable and practical: each item should say what is missing, why it matters, and any Linq-specific caveats.

## Current adapter status

The adapter can already handle the core receive/reply path:

- Verify signed Linq webhooks.
- Convert inbound `message.received` events into Chat SDK messages.
- Send text replies to an existing Linq chat.
- Fetch thread metadata with `chats.retrieve()`.
- Fetch recent chat history with `chats.messages.list()`.
- Fetch a single message with `messages.retrieve()`.
- Edit text messages with `messages.update()`.
- Render formatted Chat SDK content as markdown text.
- Add and remove reactions with `messages.addReaction()`.
- Encode stable Linq thread IDs (`linq:<chatId>`) so webhook and API paths map to the same thread.
- Track direct-message vs group-chat identity in-memory from webhooks and chat fetches (legacy `linq:<chatId>:dm/group` IDs still decode).
- Resolve unknown chat identity via `chats.retrieve()` before dispatching webhooks that omit `is_group`.
- Skip typing indicators for known group chats and ignore Linq's expected group-chat typing rejection.
- Show typing indicators for direct-message chats.
- Automatically subscribe and respond to inbound Linq group chats received through webhooks.

## Work still left

### 1. Richer inbound message parsing

Status: **basic but useful**

Current parsing handles:

- text parts
- URLs in text as Chat SDK links
- link parts as text and Chat SDK links
- media-only messages with useful attachment summary text
- media parts as Chat SDK attachments with downloadable data
- Linq reply metadata preserved on `message.raw.reply_to`
- sender identity
- basic sent timestamp
- edited metadata when using retrieved/listed message payloads

Covered by adapter tests:

- text message parsing
- URL extraction from text
- link part parsing
- media attachment parsing
- reply metadata preservation
- edited metadata on retrieved/listed messages
- direct-message/group thread ID detection
- group-safe typing indicators

Still missing:

- first-class normalized reply/thread metadata beyond `message.raw.reply_to`
- edited metadata from edit webhooks, if we subscribe to them later
- delivered/read status in a normalized Chat SDK surface
- reactions on inbound message parts
- richer link preview metadata beyond the URL

### 2. Outbound attachments and media

Status: **not implemented**

Current `postMessage()` sends text only.

Future support should map Chat SDK attachments/files to Linq media parts.

Likely areas to check:

- Linq attachment upload/create endpoints
- Linq media part requirements
- file size and MIME type limits

### 3. Inbound reaction webhooks

Status: **not implemented**

Outbound add/remove reactions work.

Inbound reaction events are not routed into Chat SDK yet.

Future support should subscribe to:

- `reaction.added`
- `reaction.removed`

Then map those webhooks into `chat.processReaction()`.

## Will not implement

These are intentional adapter boundaries, not backlog items.



### Opening new direct messages / creating chats

Linq creates chats with an initial message.

Chat SDK `openDM()` expects to return a thread before posting, so the semantics do not line up cleanly.

This reference adapter will not implement `openDM()` or generic chat creation APIs. It only sends replies to existing Linq chats received through webhooks.



### Starting new group chats / outbound group messages

Linq group chats also require chat creation semantics and an initial message.

This reference adapter will not implement APIs for creating group chats or starting outbound group-message conversations.

Existing group chats received through webhooks are still parsed, automatically subscribed, replied to with `postMessage()`, and detected as non-DM threads.



### Delete messages

Linq's delete endpoint only deletes the message from the Linq API.

It does **not** unsend or remove the message from the recipient's chat.

Because Chat SDK callers usually expect `deleteMessage()` to remove the visible chat message, implementing this directly would be misleading.

Only revisit if product explicitly accepts the narrower Linq semantics.



### Native streaming

Linq does not have native streaming message support.

The adapter should keep buffering stream text and posting once.

Chat SDK fallback streaming via edits is technically possible now that `editMessage()` exists, but Linq edit limits make long streaming risky.

Do not turn fallback streaming on by default.



### Channel and thread listing APIs

Linq does not have the same channel/thread split that platforms like Slack have.

Do not implement channel-level APIs or generic thread listing unless the app has a concrete product need.



### Chat UI surfaces

Linq does not provide equivalents for Chat SDK modals, app home, slash commands, buttons, selects, or interactive cards.

Do not implement modal/action/slash-command/app-home APIs for this adapter.



### Ephemeral and scheduled messages

Linq does not expose native ephemeral or scheduled message semantics that match Chat SDK expectations.

Do not implement these unless Linq adds matching primitives.
