# @linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter

[Linq](https://linqapp.com) adapter for [Chat SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chat) (`chat`). Build agentic chatbots that talk over iMessage and SMS through Linq, using the same handler code you'd write for Slack, Telegram, or WhatsApp.

## Install

```bash
npm install @linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter chat
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { createLinqAdapter } from "@linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter";
import { Chat } from "chat";

const chat = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    linq: createLinqAdapter({
      apiKey: process.env.LINQ_API_KEY!,
      signingSecret: process.env.LINQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
    }),
  },
});

chat.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post(`you said: ${message.text}`);
});

chat.onReaction(["thumbs_up"], async (event) => {
  await event.thread.post("appreciate the tapback 🫡");
});
```

Then route Linq webhooks to the adapter from any framework with fetch-style handlers:

```ts
// e.g. a Nitro/Next.js/Hono POST route
export default async (request: Request) => {
  return chat.webhooks.linq(request);
};
```

Point a [Linq webhook subscription](https://docs.linqapp.com) at that route and subscribe to at least:

- `message.received`
- `reaction.added`
- `reaction.removed`

Other event types are acknowledged with a `200` and ignored.

## Configuration

| Option            | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apiKey`          | direct   | Linq API key used for all outbound API calls.                                                                            |
| `signingSecret`   | direct   | Webhook signing secret. Requests are verified with HMAC-SHA256 over `{timestamp}.{raw_body}`, with replay-window checks. |
| `credentials`     | managed  | Lazy function returning `{ apiKey, signingSecret }`; use this for rotated or externally managed credentials.             |
| `webhookVerifier` | no       | Verifies a trusted forwarded webhook using the unmodified raw body. Takes precedence over `signingSecret`.               |
| `baseURL`         | no       | Override the Linq API base URL (e.g. sandbox).                                                                           |

Use either the direct `apiKey` + `signingSecret` pair or `credentials`. A trusted
webhook forwarder can use `webhookVerifier` instead of Linq's direct signature:

```ts
createLinqAdapter({
  credentials: async () => ({
    apiKey: await secrets.get("linq-api-key"),
    signingSecret: await secrets.get("linq-webhook-secret"),
  }),
  webhookVerifier: async (request, rawBody) => verifyForwardedWebhook(request, rawBody),
});
```

| `openDM()` / creating chats                        | ❌ Linq creates chats with an initial message, which doesn't match Chat SDK semantics — the adapter only replies to existing chats |
| Cards                                              | ⚠️ rendered natively as plain text + image media parts — buttons/selects show their labels but cannot trigger `onAction()`         |
| Modals, slash commands                             | ❌ no Linq equivalent                                                                                                              |

## Thread IDs

Thread IDs are stable and always take the form `linq:{chatId}`, regardless of whether the thread was first seen via webhook or API. Group vs DM identity is tracked internally from webhook payloads and `chats.retrieve()` calls; legacy `linq:{chatId}:group` / `linq:{chatId}:dm` IDs from older versions still decode.

## Attachments

Attach media by putting `attachments` or `files` on a message:

```ts
await thread.post({
  markdown: "here's the report 📎",
  attachments: [
    { type: "file", url: "https://example.com/report.pdf", mimeType: "application/pdf" },
  ],
});

// or send raw bytes
await thread.post({
  markdown: "fresh render",
  files: [{ filename: "render.png", mimeType: "image/png", data: pngBuffer }],
});
```

How each attachment is delivered:

- **Public HTTPS URL, ≤ 10MB** — sent by reference; Linq downloads it on send. No upload round-trip, so forwarding inbound Linq media (already on `cdn.linqapp.com`) is free.
- **Raw bytes, non-HTTPS URLs, or files > 10MB** — uploaded via `POST /v3/attachments` (up to 100MB) and sent by `attachment_id`.

A message can be media-only (no text). Inbound attachments expose `fetchData()` to download, and survive queue serialization via `rehydrateAttachment` (Linq CDN URLs don't expire). Audio is sent as a downloadable file attachment — the dedicated iMessage voice-memo bubble endpoint isn't wired up yet.

## Cards

iMessage/SMS has no rich-card UI, so Chat SDK [cards](https://chat-sdk.dev/docs/cards) are flattened to their closest native equivalent instead of being dropped:

- Title, subtitle, text, fields, links, dividers, and tables render as clean plain text (markdown is stripped — iMessage would show literal `**`).
- `<Image>` elements and the card's `imageUrl` are sent as real image media parts (public HTTPS URLs only; other URLs stay visible in the text).
- Buttons and selects render their labels (e.g. `Options: Approve, Reject`) so the recipient sees what the card offers — but there are no tappable buttons on iMessage, so `onAction()` handlers never fire from this adapter. The adapter logs a warning on every such send so the degradation is visible instead of silent. If you need a working action, include a `LinkButton`/`CardLink` URL or handle plain text replies.
- An explicit `fallbackText` on `{ card, fallbackText }` replaces the generated text; card images are still attached.

```tsx
await thread.post(
  <Card title="Order #1234">
    <Image url="https://example.com/receipt.png" alt="Receipt" />
    <CardText>Your order has been received!</CardText>
    <CardLink url="https://example.com/orders/1234" label="Track order" />
  </Card>,
);
// → one iMessage: text bubble + attached receipt image
```

## Reactions

Standard iMessage tapbacks map to normalized Chat SDK emoji in both directions:

| Linq tapback | Chat SDK emoji |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `like`       | `thumbs_up`    |
| `dislike`    | `thumbs_down`  |
| `love`       | `heart`        |
| `laugh`      | `laugh`        |
| `emphasize`  | `exclamation`  |
| `question`   | `question`     |

Custom emoji reactions pass through the default emoji resolver (e.g. `👍` → `thumbs_up`), falling back to the raw emoji for anything unmapped.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test        # vitest
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

A full example app (Nitro server wiring Linq, Telegram, and WhatsApp adapters into one bot) lives in [`apps/api`](../../apps/api) in this repo.

## Live smoke test

`smoke-live.mjs` drives this adapter against the **real Linq API** so you can validate a sandbox in one command. Run `pnpm build` first (it imports `./dist`).

Get a sandbox number with the [Linq CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linqapp/cli): `linq signup --phone <your cell>`, then grab the token from `~/.linq/config.json`.

```bash
# outbound: bootstrap a chat and send text + two images (one by URL, one pre-uploaded)
LINQ_API_KEY=<token> LINQ_FROM=<sandbox number> LINQ_TEST_TO=<your cell> \
  node smoke-live.mjs send

# cards: send Chat SDK cards end-to-end — a full text card, a card with an image,
# and the image+buttons-only card that used to silently vanish
LINQ_API_KEY=<token> LINQ_FROM=<sandbox number> LINQ_TEST_TO=<your cell> \
  node smoke-live.mjs cards

# inbound: receive real webhooks (text + reactions), optionally echo-reply
LINQ_API_KEY=<token> LINQ_SIGNING_SECRET=<webhook secret> LINQ_ECHO=1 \
  node smoke-live.mjs serve
# then tunnel it (cloudflared/ngrok) and register the URL as a Linq webhook subscription
```

| `LINQ_FROM` / `LINQ_TEST_TO` | send  | sender (sandbox) number / your phone — or set `LINQ_TEST_CHAT_ID` to reuse a chat |
| `LINQ_SIGNING_SECRET`        | serve | webhook signing secret (from the subscription)                                    |
| `LINQ_BASE_URL`              | both  | override API base URL (optional)                                                  |
| `LINQ_ECHO=1`                | serve | reply to inbound messages so you get a round-trip on the device                   |
