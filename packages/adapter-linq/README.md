# @linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter

[Linq](https://linqapp.com) adapter for [Chat SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chat) (`chat`). Build agentic chatbots that talk over iMessage and SMS through Linq, using the same handler code you'd write for Slack, Telegram, or WhatsApp.

## Install

```bash
npm install @linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter chat
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { createLinqAdapter } from "@linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter";
import { Chat } from "chat";

const chat = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: {
    linq: createLinqAdapter({
      apiKey: process.env.LINQ_API_KEY!,
      signingSecret: process.env.LINQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
    }),
  },
});

chat.onDirectMessage(async (thread, message) => {
  await thread.subscribe();
  await thread.post(`you said: ${message.text}`);
});

chat.onReaction(["thumbs_up"], async (event) => {
  await event.thread.post("appreciate the tapback 🫡");
});
```

Then route Linq webhooks to the adapter from any framework with fetch-style handlers:

```ts
// e.g. a Nitro/Next.js/Hono POST route
export default async (request: Request) => {
  return chat.webhooks.linq(request);
};
```

Point a [Linq webhook subscription](https://docs.linqapp.com) at that route and subscribe to at least:

- `message.received`
- `reaction.added`
- `reaction.removed`

Other event types are acknowledged with a `200` and ignored.

| `openDM()` / creating chats                        | ❌ Linq creates chats with an initial message, which doesn't match Chat SDK semantics — the adapter only replies to existing chats |
| Modals, cards, slash commands                      | ❌ no Linq equivalent — cards render as fallback text                                                                              |

## Thread IDs

Thread IDs are stable and always take the form `linq:{chatId}`, regardless of whether the thread was first seen via webhook or API. Group vs DM identity is tracked internally from webhook payloads and `chats.retrieve()` calls; legacy `linq:{chatId}:group` / `linq:{chatId}:dm` IDs from older versions still decode.

## Attachments

Attach media by putting `attachments` or `files` on a message:

```ts
await thread.post({
  markdown: "here's the report 📎",
  attachments: [{ type: "file", url: "https://example.com/report.pdf", mimeType: "application/pdf" }],
});

// or send raw bytes
await thread.post({
  markdown: "fresh render",
  files: [{ filename: "render.png", mimeType: "image/png", data: pngBuffer }],
});
```

How each attachment is delivered:

- **Public HTTPS URL, ≤ 10MB** — sent by reference; Linq downloads it on send. No upload round-trip, so forwarding inbound Linq media (already on `cdn.linqapp.com`) is free.
- **Raw bytes, non-HTTPS URLs, or files > 10MB** — uploaded via `POST /v3/attachments` (up to 100MB) and sent by `attachment_id`.

A message can be media-only (no text). Inbound attachments expose `fetchData()` to download, and survive queue serialization via `rehydrateAttachment` (Linq CDN URLs don't expire). Audio is sent as a downloadable file attachment — the dedicated iMessage voice-memo bubble endpoint isn't wired up yet.

## Reactions

Standard iMessage tapbacks map to normalized Chat SDK emoji in both directions:

| Linq tapback | Chat SDK emoji |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `like`       | `thumbs_up`    |
| `dislike`    | `thumbs_down`  |
| `love`       | `heart`        |
| `laugh`      | `laugh`        |
| `emphasize`  | `exclamation`  |
| `question`   | `question`     |

Custom emoji reactions pass through the default emoji resolver (e.g. `👍` → `thumbs_up`), falling back to the raw emoji for anything unmapped.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test        # vitest
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

A full example app (Nitro server wiring Linq, Telegram, and WhatsApp adapters into one bot) lives in [`apps/api`](../../apps/api) in this repo.

## Live smoke test

`smoke-live.mjs` drives this adapter against the **real Linq API** so you can validate a sandbox in one command. Run `pnpm build` first (it imports `./dist`).

Get a sandbox number with the [Linq CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linqapp/cli): `linq signup --phone <your cell>`, then grab the token from `~/.linq/config.json`.

```bash
# outbound: bootstrap a chat and send text + two images (one by URL, one pre-uploaded)
LINQ_API_KEY=<token> LINQ_FROM=<sandbox number> LINQ_TEST_TO=<your cell> \
  node smoke-live.mjs send

# inbound: receive real webhooks (text + reactions), optionally echo-reply
LINQ_API_KEY=<token> LINQ_SIGNING_SECRET=<webhook secret> LINQ_ECHO=1 \
  node smoke-live.mjs serve
# then tunnel it (cloudflared/ngrok) and register the URL as a Linq webhook subscription
```

| Env | Mode | Purpose |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| `LINQ_API_KEY` | both | Linq API token |
| `LINQ_FROM` / `LINQ_TEST_TO` | send | sender (sandbox) number / your phone — or set `LINQ_TEST_CHAT_ID` to reuse a chat |
| `LINQ_SIGNING_SECRET` | serve | webhook signing secret (from the subscription) |
| `LINQ_BASE_URL` | both | override API base URL (optional) |
| `LINQ_ECHO=1` | serve | reply to inbound messages so you get a round-trip on the device |
